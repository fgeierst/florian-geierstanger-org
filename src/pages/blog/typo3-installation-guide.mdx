## Prerequisites

Install [Docker Desktop and DDEV Local](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/) (macOS, Windows/WSL 2, Linux).

Start Docker Desktop from the command line with `open -a Docker` (macOS).

## Make a new directory for your project

(for example in the folder _~/Projects/_)

```shell
mkdir my-new-project
cd my-new-project
```

## Setup a DDEV project, download and install TYPO3 with Composer

The following steps are taken from [get.typo3.org](https://get.typo3.org/).

```shell
ddev config --project-type=typo3 --docroot=public --create-docroot
ddev composer create --no-install "typo3/cms-base-distribution:^11.5"
ddev composer install
ddev typo3cms install:setup
```

- When prompted, you may use these conventions for local development
  - username: `admin`
  - password: `password`
- When prompted to _Specify the site setup type_, select `site`

## Create a folder for local composer packages and configure Composer accordingly

```bash
mkdir -p packages
ddev composer config repositories.local path "packages/*"
```

## Create a new base package

- Go to [sitepackagebuilder.com](https://www.sitepackagebuilder.com/new/)
- Select _Fluid Styled Content_ as a base package
- Company and title fields will be used to generate namespace and package name, so you might want to keep these rather short
- Add ` base` to the end of your title (for example `my new project base`) to indicate this is your basepackage.
- Create new folder `mkdir packages`
- Download the and extract the .zip file and copy the folder to /packages/

## Give the base package a version number

Open _/packages/my_new_project_base/composer.json_ in your code editor and add a new entry for the version:

```json
{
  "name": "my-company/my-new-project-base",
  "version": "0.0.1"
}
```

## Require the new base package with composer

Use name and version from above:

```bash
ddev composer require my-company/my-new-project-base:^0.0.1
```

## Import setup and configuration typoscript from your base package

Open the TYPO3 backend in your browser

```shell
ddev launch typo3
```

- Open the Template module
- In the pagetree, select the rootpage ("Home", globe icon)
- Open the _Info/modify_ pane
- Click in the _Edit the whole template record_ button
- Under _Constants_ add this line

```
@import 'EXT:my_new_project_base/Configuration/TypoScript/constants.typoscript'
```

- Under _Setup_, remove the existing typoscript code and replace it with

```
@import 'EXT:my_new_project_base/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript'
```

Done!

## Background

As a frontend developer setting up new projects is not my day to day business. However I find it useful to be able to quickly spin up a fresh TYPO3 installation. With this I'm able to try out new ideas, like the [TYPO3 Vite integration](/blog/typo3-vite/). Having access to a barebones installation also helps me to understand things better, compared to the grown and rather large projects I usually work with.
