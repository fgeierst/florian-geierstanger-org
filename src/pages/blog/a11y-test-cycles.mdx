## Feature Test Cycle

- **Who tests:** Designers and developers within the team
- **What is tested:** Individual components and features during development
- **How it's tested:** Against selected accessibility criteria, often with automated tools and targeted manual checks
- **Characteristics:** Fast, proactive, cost-effective
- **Limitation:** Not exhaustive – focuses on common problems and core criteria

## App Test Cycle

- **Who tests:** External accessibility experts
- **What is tested:** The entire application as a whole
- **How it's tested:** Complete manual audit against all relevant criteria (e.g., WCAG 2.2, EN 301 549)
- **Characteristics:** Thorough, comprehensive, authoritative assessment
- **Challenges:** Slow, expensive, reactive, often creates large backlogs
