This is my setup to programmatically test TYPO3 frontend code. It uses Playwright to run end-to-end tests on individual Fluid Components. To be able to test the components in isolation, I use Fluid Styleguide's fixture files to populate the component with mockup data.

As an extra step, Axe-core is used as an plugin within Playwright to do automated accessibility testing.

Playwright runs it's test using headless Chromium, Webkit and Firefox browsers. For me this turned out especially usefull after updating NPM dependencies: `npx taze major -w && ddev npm i && npx playwright test`.
