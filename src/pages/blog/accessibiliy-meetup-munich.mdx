Annett Farnetani an I have restarted the [Accessibility Meetup Munich](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/accessibility-meetup-munich/).

The group has existed previously from 2018 to 2020. The _former group_ does no longer exist on Meetup.com, but the Internet Archive has archived some of it, and there is still some content on social media:
