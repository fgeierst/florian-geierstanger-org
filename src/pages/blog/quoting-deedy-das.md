# Quoting Deedy Das

> The joy of coding used to be you're stuck on this annoyingly hard problem and you just bang your head against a wall and you want to kill yourself and then eventually you're like, I've figured it out and then you solve it. And that's the muscle that you build when you improve and get better. 

> And now — I find myself even doing this — it's so hard to do if you just have a constant slot machine that might give you the right answer. And who knows if it will, who knows if it doesn't, but you just pull it all day long. Please fix, please fix, please fix. And what does that mean for the craft of engineering or software engineering in the future?

> This vibe coding stuff, I'm now seeing how it's affecting the trained software engineers and it's kind of like a drug for them. And it stops them from like living their own life, which is doing the engineering because... it turns your brain off. 

> And over time, the brain will get weaker if you don't use it for that task.
