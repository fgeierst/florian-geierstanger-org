# Quoting Todd Harper

“But pedagogically, educationally, we don't assign homework, papers, presentations, projects. We don't give those to students because we want something in return. The thing that they give to us is not the point.

The point is that when they're looking up sources or drawing the art or creating the thing that they turn into us, they are exercising the skills and the learning that we want them to develop in our classroom, that they have come to our classroom to develop. And yes, we have to evaluate them and we can't be there for the process, so they do have to turn something into us, right? Like the product is how we evaluate the process through the result.

But the process is the important bit. And if what's turned into me, you know, air quotes, looks right, you know, looks plausible, which LLMs could be good at. In fact, it's probably the only thing they're air quotes good at.

It's making things that look plausible. But if the student didn't do it, if there was no process, then what are we doing here? No real learning has happened.”
