In the latest [Metamuse episode](https://museapp.com/podcast/62-community/) Logseq's Ramses Oudt talks about how communities of users form around certain products, especially games. And why and how product teams promote or even deliberately start these spaces for social interaction. 

<Blockquote author='@fabianstelzer' url='https://twitter.com/fabianstelzer/status/1561019342451531776'>Midjourney has an incredibly large and active community of almost 1M people.</Blockquote>

I'm hearing this for some time now to not underestimate the impact of Discord for product strategy. But this comparison between Midjourney, DALL-E and StableDiffusion in the tweet quoted above is wild: there are nearly one million active users in Midjourney's Discord server.
Midjourney product managers clearly took a right decision making Discord the main user interface and thus having communication between users a first class feature.

A "community-first" user interface.
