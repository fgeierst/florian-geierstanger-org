<Blockquote author="François Chollet">
  To really understand a concept, you have to "invent" it yourself in some
  capacity. Understanding doesn't come from passive content consumption. It is
  always self-built. It is an active, high-agency, self-directed process of
  creating and debugging your own mental models.
