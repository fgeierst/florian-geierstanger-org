"What meaning have the connections between the stories and my own life?" (First attempt)

A movie about connections of stories a person tells, with his own life. The stories differ in it's degree of realism, they differ in the character of their connection with the life of a young woman: One story is biographical, originating from her own past. The second story is her passing on a relation, retelling, handing down a story from the treasure chest of narratives her catholic family possesses. It's the St.-Paul-story. The third story is invented, a speculation on her future. (from the concept)
