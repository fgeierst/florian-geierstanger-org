A scent can sneak into your mind and sink deep into your memories. Just like a poem can leave a lasting impression. And just like a reader’s voice leaves its traces. The melody of his sentences reveals where he comes from. This is the beginning of the film telling us: we are in Oberpfalz, in the northeast of Bavaria. A young guy recounts the story of his life. He started out as a car mechanic, worked as a shiftman in the supply industry, in winter road maintenance, filled shelves in supermarkets, worked as a temp. He also talks about scents he remembers. The perfume of his grandfather who drove him to school for a while: Aramis. The scent of his elder brother who taught him how to spin a basketball on your finger: Jean Paul Gaultier. Both storys intertwine at the end: in his new job as a perfume salesman.
