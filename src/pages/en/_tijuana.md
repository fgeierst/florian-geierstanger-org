The curtain rises, the borders fall: a city between the Third and the First World. A piece for two photographers, three visual artists and four writers, interpreted by two Europeans. A gardener builds a Japanese Zen garden from Hitachi television sets. A young woman takes pictures of outer space in a storage building. A group of writers sell poems at a takeaways and a professor of literature converses with ravens. The borderlands are open, the curtain falls.

  
A documentary film by Diana Grothues and Florian Geierstanger Running time: 35 min, Language: Spanish, Subtitles: English, German, Shot in March 2006 in Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (U.S.A.)
