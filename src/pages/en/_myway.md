Bruno Roth did a lot of things during his life so far: a skilfully marketer of his own physical qualifications, he alternated between working as a model, body builder, singer and coiffeur. His biography is opposed by other marketing strategies: advertisements, event notes and road signs. Abruptly included are songs, a bizarre mixture of different styles and epochs.
